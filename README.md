Credential Exchange is a collection of Rust libraries for working with the
[Credential Exchange Specifications](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/).

For more information about the credential exchange protocol, please read the

or the
[Fido Alliance announcement](https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/).

## Disclaimer

This library is still in early development and as the specification evolves so will this library.

## Structure

It's currently comprised of a single crate:

- `credential-exchange-types`: Type definitions from the specification.

# Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP)

This crate contains type definitions for the
[FIDO Allianceâ€™s credential exchange](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/)
protocol specification. It's targeting the
[Working Draft, October 03, 2024](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/cx/cxp-v1.0-wd-20241003.html)
revision.

For more information about the credential exchange protocol, please read the
[Bitwarden blog post](https://bitwarden.com/blog/security-vendors-join-forces-to-make-passkeys-more-portable-for-everyone/)
or the
[Fido Alliance announcement](https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/).

## Disclaimer

> This library does not automatically clear sensitive values from memory. It is heavily encouraged
> to use it alongside a zeroizing global allocator like
> [`zeroizing-alloc`](https://crates.io/crates/zeroizing-alloc). We may be open to pull requests
> that adds native `zeroize` support depending on the developer ergonomics.

> This library is still in early development and as the specification evolves so will this library.
